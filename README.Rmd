# SAGEStools

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of SAGEStools is to be a repository of functions to make it easier to work with SAGES data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of SAGEStools from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dougtommet/SAGEStools")
```

## Example

This is only one function currently in the package.  Here is how you would use it to search the codebook for variables of interest.

```{r example}
# library(SAGEStools)
# qsagesmetadata("ID")
```
